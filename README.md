# FizzBuzz
The classic FizzBuzz function, but with optional parameters to adjust which integers to 'fizz' and 'buzz' on.

The function 'fizzbuzz' requires 3 parameters:

  'target' is the number up to which we want to count
  
  'fizz_multiple' is the divisor for a 'fizz' result. So for fizz_multiple = 2, any integer divisible by 2 will return a 'fizz' - unless it also meets the criteria for 'buzz-    multiple', in which case the function will return a 'buzz' 
  
  'buzz_multiple' is the same idea as 'fizz_multiple', but for 'buzz'
